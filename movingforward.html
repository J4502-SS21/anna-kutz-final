  <h1> Moving Forward: What's the Future Looking Like? </h1>
<p> If this website has taught you anything, it should be the rapid change in the fashion industry within the last century, and the effects on the environment that have resulted since.</p>
  <p> With all the knowledge we know have about the dangerous effects that fashion consumption can have on the environment, it's important to look at the bigger picture: where will this take us, as a world? Below is some data on the future of the environment if fashion practices don't change and a follow-up quiz to test your knowledge on the possible outcome.  </p>

<P> First, I'll add some data to show what the future is looking like if things DON'T change -- something like these charts, but I'll make them myself: </p>

  </a>

<p> Then, I'll go ahead and add a quiz -- about turning points in history, vocab terms, and the overall issue at hand. </p>
<p> Here's a picture of a white vertical background, just to give you an idea of how I want the quiz to run vertically down the remaining part of the page.</p>
