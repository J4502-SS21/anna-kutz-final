  <h1>Fast Fashion Kills: The Environmental Impact of Clothing Production</h1>
  <p> The fashion industry has changed dramatically over the last 100 years. In order to see the affect that the shift from traditional clothing practices to fast fashion practices has had on our environment, it's necessary to see the full picture.</p>
  <p> In a world that moves as fast as ours does, it's only natural that the relationship between people and our clothes has evolved as the United States was rapidly industrialized and commercialized. But this growth can not go hand in hand with environmental protection, as is evidenced by data that warns of the detrimental environmental and climate impact of fast, cheap fashion.</p>
  <p>On this website, you will find a vocabulary list of important terms, a timeline that dissects the changes both the fashion industry and environment have undergone since 1920, and a mini quiz to test your comprehension of the data presented.</p>
