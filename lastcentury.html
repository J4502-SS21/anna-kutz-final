  <h1> The Last Century: A Helpful Look Through Time </h1>
  <p> Before industralization and commercialism were normalized in the United States, people would wear their clothes until they couldn't anymore -- and then those clothes would take on other purposes. Waste not, want not was the norm. The rise of clothing factories, increased consumerism culture, and change in societal views about fashion allowed clothes to take on a new cultural identity: one of expression and uniqueness, of changing with the seasons and years. </p>
  <p> The transition from traditional, more conservationist, practices to an ultra-capitalist society where clothes are a commodity and not a necessity was not a quick one. Only in the last century has the shift been easily noticeable, and so have the environmental changes that came along with it.</p>
  <p> Below is a timeline spanning roughly from 1920 to 2020, encapsulating the growth of the fashion industry, the waste industry, pollution, fast fashion, and their intersections in order to paint a full picture of the issues at hand. </p>

        <h3>World War I</h3>
        <p>When the first World War broke out, there was an extreme push for sustainable clothing practices and wearing things until they couldn't be worn anymore. Even when they were down to scraps, the clothing pieces would be reworked into new material, such as bags to store rice in or cleaning cloths. This was because materials and time were both scarce as the war carried on. This resulted in a 10% decrease in trash products and simplified clothing choices for those back home. </p>

        <h3>Rise of Consumerism and Consumption</h3>
        <p>With World War I over right before the 1920s began, victory was sweet and war rations were no longer an issue. This, combined with the invention of the assembly line and rise of factories in large cities - known as the height of the industrial revolution - made way for a new, material type of way to live. Gone were the days of keeping your clothes and using them until they disentegrated; now, people could buy cheaper, factory made clothes and have wardrobes that changed with the seasons and trends. This was the start of today's consumerist culture that, under capitalism, has expanded our trash output exponentially. </p>
