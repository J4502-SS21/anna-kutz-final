  <h1> The Last Century: A Helpful Look Through Time </h1>
  <p> Before industralization and commercialism were normalized in the United States, people would wear their clothes until they couldn't anymore -- and then those clothes would take on other purposes.</p>
  <p>Waste not, want not was the norm. The rise of clothing factories, increased consumerism culture, and change in societal views about fashion allowed clothes to take on a new cultural identity: one of expression and uniqueness, of changing with the seasons and years. </p>
  <p> The transition from traditional, more conservationist, practices to an ultra-capitalist society where clothes are a commodity and not a necessity was not a quick one. Only in the last century has the shift been easily noticeable, and so have the environmental changes that came along with it.</p>
  <p> Below is a timeline spanning roughly from 1920 to 2020, encapsulating the growth of the fashion industry, the waste industry, pollution, fast fashion, and their intersections in order to paint a comprehensive picture of the issues at hand. </p>

        <h3>World War I</h3>
        <p>When the first World War broke out, there was an extreme push for sustainable clothing practices and wearing things until they couldn't be worn anymore. Even when they were down to scraps, the clothing pieces would be reworked into new material, such as bags to store rice in or cleaning cloths. This was because materials and time were both scarce as the war carried on. This resulted in a 10% decrease in trash products and simplified clothing choices for those back home, even though the U.S. had just completed its industrial revolution. </p>

        <h3>Rise of Consumerism and Consumption</h3>
        <p>With World War I over right before the 1920s began, victory was sweet and war rations were no longer an issue. This, combined with the invention of the assembly line and rise of factories in large cities - known as the height of the industrial revolution - made way for a new, material type of way to live. Gone were the days of keeping your clothes and using them until they disentegrated; now, people could buy cheaper, factory made clothes and have wardrobes that changed with the seasons and trends. This was the start of today's consumerist culture that, under capitalism, has expanded our trash output exponentially. </p>

        <h3>World War II</h3>
        <p>With men off at war, women took to the factories and worked in their stead. One of the industries they were most involved in was clothing production. During the years of WWII, fashion was less of a personal, handmade thing, with clothing shifting to be more functional, everyday styles that were easily produced en masse. Because of this, there was a 10-15% increase in clothing production. That growth was unprecedented then and, ever since, it has been exponential.</p>

        <h3>Fads, Trends, and Growth of Demand</h3>
        <p>With the wars that shocked the world over and America experiencing a golden era of wealth and comfort, there was more creative expression allowed in people. This led to the development of fad fashion -- preppy dressers, hippies, rockers, and more all wanted something that fit their own ideal style and, as technology increased exponentially, stores adapted to selling a wide variety of fashion trends.</p>
        <p> In order to accomodate for this new varied, mass-produced demand, clothing companies began outsourcing their work to smaller, developing countries -- known as LMICs.</p>

        <h3>The Growth of Chain Fashion and the start of Fast Fashion</h3>
        <p>By the time the 1980s rolled around, large retail chains like Sears, JCPenney, Kohls, Dillards, and Macys were staples in every shopping mall. The popularity of malls in the '80s and '90s -- which featured mass produced fashion from, mostly, overseas factories -- contributed greatly to this second wave of consumerism. With chain stores firmly established, it only made sense for fashion brands to expand online as the internet came into extreme popularity in the 2000s and 2010s. With this, the start of large corporate fast fashion brands began.</p>

        <h3>Fast Fashion, Today</h3>
        <p>The use of mills in LMICs and sweatshop labor is what fuels the industry, but it is detrimental to the environment. With brands like Zara, H&M, UNIQLO, Missguided, Fashion Nova, ROMWE, SHEIN and more taking the center stage in speedy, ultra cheap fashion finds, the environment and workers suffer the consequences. According to a <a href="https://bust.com/style/12307-the-true-price-of-fast-fashion.html">Bust article</a>, "Workers in Bangladesh, where 80 percent of the country’s exports are apparel, currently earn the lowest minimum wage in the world, taking home about $43 a month. Chinese factory workers make slightly more: $117 to $147 a month. In contrast, American garment workers earn about $9 an hour, taking home $1,660 a month."  </p>

        <h3>The Envrionment, today</h3>
        <p>According to an <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12940-018-0433-7">Environmental Health </a> article, "Globally, 80 billion pieces of new clothing are purchased each year, translating to $1.2 trillion annually for the global fashion industry. The majority of these products are assembled in China and Bangladesh while the United States consumes more clothing and textiles than any other nation in the world. Approximately 85% of the clothing Americans consume, nearly 3.8 billion pounds annually, is sent to landfills as solid waste, amounting to nearly 80 pounds per American per year." The amount of total MSW that is the result of the fast fashion industry is ridiculously large, especially compared to the start of the 20th century, when clothing was treasured and recycled 'til it was no longer of use.</p>
